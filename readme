Initial version of a Rapt-Touch Logger - heavily inpired by a Charles Petzold PointerLog 
sample application with added support for remote Logging via MetroLog.

Open the Rapt-Touch-Logger.sln in Developer Studio and build it.

When it is run, it creates a nice one screen log of the different touch and mouse events. You can 
use clear to clear the screen for the next event.

If you run the application it will log events at trace level to the Windows debug logger. A 'Metro
style' has restrictions on where it can log and most developers recommend using the debug logger 
with the added advantage of the MetroLog support is to allow for different output formats and log 
levels.

So, to see the output log either run the application in debug and the events are logged as they 
happen in the output log or download DebugView from Microsoft, run as Admin and either run in the 
background or remotely connect to the windows8 tablet and look at the events as they happen.

I tested it with Splashtop, the trackpad and an external mouse and it seemed to get events (and
log them differently from each), splashtop was able to generate multi-touch events.
