Initial version of a Rapt-Touch Logger - heavily inpired by a Charles Petzold PointerLog 
sample application with added support for remote Logging via MetroLog.

Open the Rapt-Touch-Logger.sln in Developer Studio and build it.

If you run it will log events at trace level to the Windows debug logger. A 'Metro style' has
restrictions on where it can log and most developers recommend using the debug logger with the
added advantage of the MetroLog support is to allow for different output formats and log levels.
